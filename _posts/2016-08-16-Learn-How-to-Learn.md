完成了Coursera上的Learn How to Learn:Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects，课程的很多内容多多少少在一些地方看到过，不过作为补充的一些采访视频和博客很有意思。  
这里是一些文章链接备份。  

* [I Was Wrong About Speed Reading: Here are the Facts](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/01/19/speed-reading-redo/)

 作者特意对自己八年前关于阅读速度两倍速的文章进行了说明和纠正，超可爱！ 
  Reading Tip  
  1. Skim Before You Read  
  Knowing how an article or book is structured  
  2. Improve Your Fluency to Improve Your Speed  
  3. Know What You Want, Before You Read It  
  4. Deeper Processing Tasks to Improve Retention

* [Poor health, lifestyle factors linked to memory complaints, even among younger adults](http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-06-poor-health-lifestyle-factors-linked.html)

很好，现在我的音乐收藏可以分为了 作业向、死线专用、小说时间、抖腿 四个栏目。

> If you're depressed, don't get enough exercise or have high blood pressure, you may find yourself complaining more about memory problems 

* [How Studying or Working Abroad Makes You Smarter](http://time.com/79937/how-studying-or-working-abroad-makes-you-smarter/)  
multicultural engagement的神奇之处，这算强行给自己找动力吗？


* [When in Rome . . . Learn Why the Romans Do What They Do: How Multicultural Learning Experiences Facilitate Creativity](http://psp.sagepub.com/content/36/6/731.full.pdf+html)
> Results showed that creativity was enhanced only when participants recalled a functional multicultural learning experience and only when participants had previously lived abroad. 
> Overall, multicultural learning appears to be an
important mechanism by which foreign living experiences lead to creative enhancement.
